# IRIS-Classification-of-Flowers-Machine-Learning-model-training
The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

In this IRIS dataset, I have performed four types of classification, viz,
1.Logistic Regression
2.SVM
3.Decision Tree
4.KNN classification

After training the dataset individually by the above mentioned Algorithms , I got the accuracies as-

Algorithms--Accuracy (in %)

1. Logistic Regression - 98.144814814814815
2. SVM -                 98.144814814814815
3. Decision Tree -       96.29629629629629
4. KNN classification -  98.144814814814815

From the above Model Accuracies, We come to know that almost Logistic Regression, SVM , KNN Classification have same accuracy. By comparing these three with Decision
Tree, we come to know that Decision Tree have the Higgest accuracy. So, Decision Tree is the best Model used to classify the Iris species.

Thank You!
